# Full models shouldn't be included in the repo, but we want
# trainable components so that we can use model weights if
# a component has already been trained. This is so others developing
# the model can use the same weights, but also so that the model can be
# assembled in a GH Action. In short, any models with
# weights that need to be sourced should not be ignored,
# but included in Git LFS.
